# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Valerie Guillen and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science. I am 18 years old, I live in Baldwin Park, and I have a cocker spaniel named Steve.

### CPSC 120

* [Lab 4](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-04-miguel-and-valerie/tree/fe987851916483eb09090995a05d4c3dbdd44905/part-1)

Lab 4 was my first favorite. There was so much to learn and do while creating the visible code, and since it was my fourth time doing this, but really, learning on my own. It was fun to work with since I was still learning in the process of how to code. This lab has helped me with the conversion ratios, and learned how to declare double variables, using cin and cout from the standard input, and create it all into a makefile.

* [Lab 9](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-09-chrystal-and-valerie/tree/875a0022b9012c53e7ab6d624b5f22437da24f44/part-1)

Lab 9 was awesome! My second favorite, and how to use the file i/o. With that we would create the if and else statements, along with the for loops. It was fun to do considering that this was like a Wordle game, trying to guess a five-letter word. There were a lot of error codes in this one in case the secret number or secret letter was guessed incorrectly, but I enjoyed all of it!

* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-12-valerie-and-brandon/tree/196db244b266e3088e0e1f4dff0c46ea6fe99bde/part-1)

Lab 12 was my third favorite, not because it was the last lab, but because it was more challenging than all the others. This one consisted of creating an animated gif! I enjoyed doing this one because it was our first animation, and we had to make sure of the differences in the color scheme: learning about RGB (Red, Green, Blue). This lab helped me learn creating for loops within the for loops.
